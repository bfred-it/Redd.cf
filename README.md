redd.cf
=================

Clone of [redditate](https://github.com/dhg/Redditate), but with several improvements:

* simpler URL support: [redd.cf/r/awww](http://redd.cf/r/awww) instead of redditate.com/?r=r/awww
* imgur GIFV support
* larger images and videos shown by default
* zooming images will fill the screen horizontally
* faster to load
    - removed 2 unnecessary plugins
    - you can zoom images as soon as you see them instead of waiting for the page to load
* some bugfixes
